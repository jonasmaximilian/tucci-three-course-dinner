<h3>Description</h3>
<p>It is best to make this dish the day before serving so that the tiramisu has ample time to set. It also freezes well.
    <br>
    You can extend  the recipe to provide more servings by folding whipped cream into the mascarpone along with the egg whites.
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup crushed amaretti cookies (optional)</li>
    <li>2 cups brewed espresso coffee</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon dark rum</li>
    <li>One 7-ounce package ladyfinger cookies</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium-size bowl, beat the egg yolkes with 6 tablespoons of the sugar until foamy and pale. Beat in the mascarpone until smooth. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer. When they are frothy, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. 
        Continue beating until they hold stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture, then fold in the crushed amaretti cookies, if using. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix the espresso with the rum in a shallow owl. Soak each ladyfinger, one at a time, in this mixture until it has softened slightly and absorbed some of the liquid.
        Arrange the cookies in a 11 x 7 x 2-inch baking dish to form a tightly packed single layer. Use pieces of broken cookies to fill in any gaps.
    </li>
    <li>Spread the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the cookies. Shake the cocoa through a fine-mesh sieve to evenly coat the top. Refrigerate to set for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
